About 2-3 inches above that interface, there is a layer of surface hoar. Persistent slabs are notoriously slow to heal, propagate widely, and these are still within the range of human trigger. They can also be triggered by cornice collapse or a wind slab avalanche.&nbsp; Any avalanche on either weak layer will be large to very large and difficult to survive. Although snowpack test results were not impressive, similar layers of rounding facets and surface hoar in the Cascades have produced numerous avalanches, some of them human-triggered. Given our uncertainty surrounding this layer, we suggest continuing to dial back your terrain selection. Reduce your exposure to avalanche terrain steeper than 35 degrees.</p>",

While the heaviest precipitation may occur before dawn, loading should continue into the day along with natural avalanches. A weak snowpack structure has been well documented through numerous observations across the zone. We expect this storm to tip the scales and cause avalanches on these buried older weak layers.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, two layers of concern exist in the upper snowpack. 1). A thin crust (2/1) with weak snow above and below. In some cases, facets and/or surface hoar were observed at this interface. Natural and triggered avalanches occurred on this layer Thursday. As it gets buried deeper it could become more reactive and produce large avalanches. 2). The 1/13 crust and facets now lay deep in the snowpack (3&rsquo; or more by Friday morning). So far, we have not seen significant avalanche activity on this layer. However, it has been very active in adjacent forecast zones. You could trigger avalanches on this layer or shallower slides might step-down and fail on these weak old snow grains.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snow pits and snowpack tests serve as great tools for tracking these persistent layers but don&rsquo;t overlook the critical &ldquo;red-flag&rdquo; data.

Like Loose Dry Avalanches, they start at a point and entrain snow as they move downhill, forming a fan-shaped avalanche. Other names for loose-wet avalanches include point-release avalanches or sluffs. Loose Wet avalanches can trigger slab avalanches that break into deeper snow layers.",

    "hazard_discussion": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recent avalanche activity, persistent weak layers, heavy precipitation, relatively mild temperatures, and strong winds check nearly all of the potential &ldquo;red-flag&rdquo; boxes for unstable snow. While the bulk of the storm arrives before dawn, significant precipitation should carry over into the day and with it the threat for natural avalanches. A well-documented weak snowpack structure exists across the entire West-South zone. The primary layer of concern remains a layer of sugary facets just above the prominent and thick 1/13 crust. As of Thursday afternoon, this layer sat 2-3&rsquo; deep in the snowpack. It will only be deeper Friday morning. The vast majority of avalanches and unstable snow observations came from the Crystal area with slightly lesser numbers from Mt St Helens and White Pass. So far, no avalanches have been reported on this layer near Paradise. Regardless, a similar snowpack structure exists in all locations, and we could see avalanche cycles peak at different times in different parts of the zone.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A second layer of concern exists in the upper snowpack. A thin crust (2/1) with weak facets potentially above and/or below has been observed in a few locations. So far, this layer did not hold a significant slab above it. As this storm piles up snow, that should change.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use snow profiles and snowpack tests to monitor these persistent weak layers, but don&rsquo;t employ them as decision-making tools. The clear &ldquo;bulls-eye&rdquo; data should speak much louder than any one hole in the snow. If you dig, help us track the weak layers by </span><a href=\"https://nwac.us/observations/submit/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">submitting an observation.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, continue to follow the latest guidance from local, state, and federal health officials.

    "bottom_line": "<p>Large and surprising natural and human triggered avalanches have occurred in the zone, running on a variety of weak layers. New snow and strong wind will continue dangerous conditions at upper elevations on Friday.&nbsp; Consider dialing back your terrain significantly, avoiding entire features where wind has created cohesive slabs, and stay alert to signs of instability such as shooting cracks and whumphs.</p>",
    "hazard_discussion": "<p>Two large, ski triggered avalanches were reported late in the day on Tuesday, one of which <a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210202_confluence-early-winters-creek-cutthroat-creek/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was a close call</a>, and on Wednesday suspected natural avalanches were observed in Portley Bowl. With recent observations of buried surface hoar from January 30th, we suspect this layer as the culprit. Observers reported about 1.5' of snow above the Jan 30th interface in the Washington Pass area. This layer presents as surface hoar or a thin sun crust on solar aspects. Professionals found this layer as small surface hoar at 5,700ft in Cutthroat on a southeast aspect, with clean planer results with tilt tests. Another potential failure layer is small facets within, or above a crust from January 13th. This prominent crust can be found about 2ft below the surface.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further east in the zone, the weakened crust from January 13th has been a concern, even below treeline. Observers in the Twisp drainage reported collapsing at 4,800ft on a northeast aspect on Monday, and snowpack tests show potential for avalanches to propagate. Also on Monday, a<a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210201_lost-river-valley-near-mazama/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> large avalanche</a> was heard in the Lost River drainage following a period of warming and light to moderate precipitation. To sum it up, we have higher uncertainty with the shallower and weaker snowpack in the eastern part of the zone. If you travel to areas such as the Chelan-Sawtooth Mountains, Twisp River, and Chewuch drainages, take time to dig in the snow and look for older weak layers. Consider traveling in lower angle terrain and smaller terrain features.&nbsp; You'll need to evaluate the upper snowpack carefully to travel safely in avalanche terrain.</p>\n<p><strong><em>During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, continue to follow the latest guidance from local, state, and federal health officials.

An observer reported a <a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210203_railroad-creek-valley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">number of large</a> (up to D2.5) avalanches with the recent storm from February 1 or 2 near Holden Village.

These likely ran on the crust from 1/13, and were roughly 24\"+ deep x 100ft wide in ridgetop, or near ridgetop terrain.

These include facets resting on a crust beneath the snow that has fallen since Jan 24th, as well as more deeply buried facets sandwiched between weak crusts. At lower elevations, you'll find less new snow and a stronger recent rain crust.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, continue to follow the latest guidance from local, state, and federal health officials.

Snowpack tests and recent human triggered avalanches all indicate you can trigger a 2-4' slab avalanche above the prominent mid-January crust. Days of snowfall and sustained windy periods have incrementally loaded this facet/crust layer and now avalanches have become potentially unmanageable in size.

    "hazard_discussion": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this storm doesn&rsquo;t look huge for the East South area, it should bring significant winds and a few inches of new snow. You could trigger avalanches in places where the winds drift the snow into deeper slabs. Blowing snow may serve as your simplest observations to identify wind loaded slopes. Drifts behind objects and changes in the depth of soft snow may also help you pick out potential trouble spots. Strong westerly winds could form slabs on exposed features at any elevation.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We don&rsquo;t know much about the snowpack structure of the East South area. However, all other zones in the Washington Cascades show persistent slabs in their forecasts. It may be a safe bet that persistent weak layers exist at least in some parts of this region too. In most areas, weak facets sit above a very thick and prominent crust (1/13). These sugary grain failed in avalanches in both adjacent zones (East Central and West South). While you can use snow profiles and snowpack tests to find and monitor these layers, don&rsquo;t risk your life based on one hole in the snow. Avalanches are most likely to fail on persistent grains underneath wind loaded pockets. As a result, give all steep wind-loaded slopes a very wide berth.

Shallowly buried obstacles, open creeks, and bare ground may block your path. The snowpack should increase dramatically as you ascend in elevation and get closer to the crest.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, continue to follow the latest guidance from local, state, and federal health officials.
