New and drifted snow is stressing persistent weak layers. You can trigger large and dangerous avalanches that break 3 feet deep and propagate wider than you would expect on slopes steeper than about 35 degrees. Stay out of trouble by choosing low-angled terrain that's sheltered from the wind and isn't exposed to steep slopes above.<\/p>","hazard_discussion":"<p>The forecast region has seen a spate of large and very large natural, <a href=\"https:\/\/flatheadavalanche.org\/observation\/remote-triggered-slide-above-crystal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">human-<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/flatheadavalanche.org\/observation\/toto-i-have-feeling-were-not-montana-anymore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">remotely triggered avalanches<\/a> over the past week. People have reported <a href=\"https:\/\/flatheadavalanche.org\/observation\/unnerving-times\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">near misses<\/a>, and at least one person was <a href=\"https:\/\/flatheadavalanche.org\/observation\/skier-caught-and-carried\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">caught, carried and slightly injured<\/a>. These slides have occurred nearly every day, not just during storms. They have been breaking very wide and running fast and far down slope. It's clear that weak layers that formed in late January have been at their tipping point for days.<\/p>\n<p>This hazard is growing even more serious as a potent storm lashes our area. As the day progressed on Thursday, natural, explosive triggered, and <a href=\"https:\/\/flatheadavalanche.org\/observation\/how-fast-can-danger-rise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">human-triggered avalanches<\/a> grew larger and failed at the new\/old interface, and on deeper buried weak layers. With more snow and winds today, the hazard will grow more widespread.<\/p>\n<p>Since midday Thursday, the Noisy Basin SNOTEL has recorded 1.6\" of new water. It may receive at least half again that much by midday Friday. The Flattop Mountain SNOTEL picked up 0.7\" of new water and may get another 0.6\" during the same time period. In the Whitefish Range, Stahl Peak reports 0.5\" of snow water equivalent. These Snow Water Equivalents amount to 5-15 inches of new snow.&nbsp; Westerly winds made slabs larger below leeward ridgelines.<\/p>\n<p>Buried surface hoar and facets are widespread at middle and upper elevations across the region. They lie under soft slabs of recent and drifted snow atop the stout mid-January crust. Slabs are bigger, and thus, the stress on weak layers is greater, as you gain elevation into terrain where winds have drifted new and recent snow. That structure -&nbsp; bed surface, sensitive weak layer, slab - is the recipe you learned about in any avalanche education you may have had. There is a lot of new loose snow at the surface, and avalanches will entrain large amounts of debris as they speed down the hill. The hazards are not limited to starting zones. Avalanches can run down to lower elevations.<\/p>","weather_discussion":null,"announcement":null,"status":"published","media":[{"id":1,"url":{"large":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/skier%20trigger%20skook%202_601d3770304f4.jpeg","medium":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/skier%20trigger%20skook%202_601d3770304f4.jpeg","original":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/skier%20trigger%20skook%202_601d3770304f4.jpeg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/skier%20trigger%20skook%202_601d3770304f4.jpeg"},"type":"image","caption":"(2\/4\/2021) Failed about a foot deep above the 1\/13 crust"},{"id":2,"url":{"large":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/shooting%20crack%20skook_601d376f92fa0.jpeg","medium":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/shooting%20crack%20skook_601d376f92fa0.jpeg","original":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/shooting%20crack%20skook_601d376f92fa0.jpeg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/shooting%20crack%20skook_601d376f92fa0.jpeg"},"type":"image","caption":"(2\/4\/2021) Long cracks shooting from skin track corners"},{"id":3,"url":{"large":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/skier%20trigger%20skook_601d376fea73e.jpeg","medium":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/skier%20trigger%20skook_601d376fea73e.jpeg","original":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/skier%20trigger%20skook_601d376fea73e.jpeg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/skier%20trigger%20skook_601d376fea73e.jpeg"},"type":"image","caption":"(2\/4\/2021) Failing on surface hoar about a foot deep"},{"id":4,"url":{"large":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/dorothy_601bfc1292252.jpeg","medium":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/dorothy_601bfc1292252.jpeg","original":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/dorothy_601bfc1292252.jpeg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/dorothy_601bfc1292252.jpeg"},"type":"image","caption":"(2\/3\/2021) Observed on 2\/3\/21"},{"id":5,"url":{"large":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/wmr_d2_601800c0be913.jpg","medium":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/wmr_d2_601800c0be913.jpg","original":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/wmr_d2_601800c0be913.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/avalanche-org-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/wmr_d2_601800c0be913.jpg"},"type":"image","caption":"(1\/31\/2021) Skier triggered Persistent Slab in Canyon Creek.
