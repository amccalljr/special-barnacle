### The Goal

Right now, we want to be able to press a button and go and get the avalanche forecast rose for every station that does it in America that is on the avalanche.org map

### TODOs
- [ ] Get a list of every forecast station in the US
- [ ] Build a scraper for each one which pulls the main roses for each subregion and stores them neatly for the day
- [ ] Build a main script to trigger each one and do the image storage (locally for now)
