    "hazard_discussion": "<p>Upper Elevation (at and above tree line)<br />The storm that moved through last Monday left 8-15&rsquo;&rsquo; of new snow in the Selkirks and Cabinets and had enough southwest winds to transport snow onto northerly slopes. A spike in snow levels on Tuesday turned snow to rain up to at least 6,000&rsquo; for some of our terrain, especially in the Selkirks near Schweitzer. You may find breakable&nbsp;<a href=\"https://avalanche.org/avalanche-encyclopedia/rain-crust\">rain crust</a>&nbsp;with a little snow on top in the upper portions of the new snow from Monday.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://avalanche.org/avalanche-encyclopedia/persistent-weak-layers\">Persistent weak layers</a>&nbsp;can be found near the interface of this somewhat recent snow and last week&rsquo;s snow as well as a little deeper, above the robust early March rain crust. These weak&nbsp;<a href=\"https://avalanche.org/avalanche-encyclopedia/layer-snow\">layers</a>&nbsp;vary, and we lack certainty on exactly where you&rsquo;ll find them. For example, we&rsquo;re seeing extended column test results with full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://avalanche.org/avalanche-encyclopedia/propagation\">propagation</a>&nbsp;on west and south&nbsp;<a href=\"https://avalanche.org/avalanche-encyclopedia/aspect\">aspects</a>&nbsp;where we less commonly see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://avalanche.org/avalanche-encyclopedia/persistent-weak-layers\">persistent slab</a>&nbsp;problems. A healthy suspicion of these weak&nbsp;<a href=\"https://avalanche.org/avalanche-encyclopedia/layer-snow\">layers</a>&nbsp;should keep you on your toes, carefully evaluating the snowpack on any steep slope you consider, and choosing low consequence terrain.</p>\n<p>Lower Elevation (in the forest)<br />Spring is here! I was surprised to see how much recent snow melt has happened up the Pack River! At lower elevations the snowpack is going through a melt/freeze process. It&rsquo;s been pretty firm riding up in the mornings but snow softens as the day goes on. Slopes that warm up throughout the day or sit in the sun become conducive to wet loose avalanches. This is an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://avalanche.org/avalanche-encyclopedia/avalanche\">avalanche</a>&nbsp;problem that&rsquo;s easier to manage than others. &nbsp;You can manage your risk by going early in the day.</p>",
