    "bottom_line": "<p><strong>Wind slabs</strong> will be your primary <strong>avalanche problem</strong> to avoid in all of our zones into the early part of the week.&nbsp; Moderate winds, primarily out of the West, with localized strong gusts have built fresh wind slabs on leeward aspects (E, NE, NW) near and above treeline.&nbsp; &nbsp;At lower elevations new storm snow and wind slabs are sitting on a rain crust from <strong>1/12</strong>, with weak sugar snow sitting above it.&nbsp; This is a bad avalanche sandwich, so dig down to see if you can find this weak interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
    "hazard_discussion": "<p>With plenty of snow available for transport, fresh wind slabs will be found near and above the treeline.&nbsp; Wind slabs generally need a couple of days to bond, so avoid wind loaded terrain &gt;30 degrees today.&nbsp; If you observe shooting cracks, visually observe cornices, wind pillows, or dune-like formations in the snow, you're looking at wind transported or affected snow.&nbsp; A wind slab has the ability to grab you off ridgelines and push you into nasty terrain features.&nbsp; Check out this <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mattentzsnow/videos/413447789726175\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a> of Matt Entz (pro snowmobiler) who recently had a near-miss with a windslab in Colorado.&nbsp; Triggering a wind slab could have much greater consequences in the Northern Wallowas, if you influence the weak snow found at the bottom of the snowpack.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, check out a local observation from the Southern Wallowas <a href=\"https://www.wallowaavalanchecenter.org/public-obs/20210206_south-side-of-cornucopia-peak/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

Here Towner and company found the 1/12 rain crust, with weak sugar snow above it, and a slab above that.  All that's waiting here is a trigger.  You may not find this rain crust at upper elevations, so do some digging to assess before committing to steep slopes > 30 degrees."
