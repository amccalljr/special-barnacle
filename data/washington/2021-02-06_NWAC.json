    "hazard_discussion": "<p>Thursday night's storm brought some light to moderate winds, but hardly any precipitation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On Thursday, NWAC and NPS professionals reported 35 inches of \"right-side-up\" or increasing density snow above the decomposing mid-January crust.&nbsp; The observers noted a significant and widespread avalanche cycle on N aspect slopes from heavy snowfall January 31 - Feb 2.&nbsp; Crowns were particularly prevalent on N-NE aspects where almost every steep, convex rollover produced an avalanche. Many were small, but some were large. Their investigation of two crowns on NE aspects at 5100 ft showed that the slide had propagated in the old snow on top of the mid-January crust.&nbsp; All natural avalanche activity occurred during the storm. It is unknown whether the slides initiated on near-surface facets just above the crust or on surface hoar a few inches higher.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some aspects could still be close to the tipping point, but just waiting for a trigger. This uncertainty warrants increased caution and a greater margin for safety on Saturday.</p>\n<p><strong>2020-21 Forecast Schedule</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Avalanche danger ratings will be issued for the Olympics every Friday through Sunday and during mid-week holidays.

Above treeline, they will become slightly larger, more widespread, and difficult to steer around. Avoid slopes with active wind loading. Check the direction of fresh sharp cornices and wind lips, rime plastered on trees, and snow stripped from trees.

Wind slab or cornice fall avalanches may be the most likely triggers on Saturday.&nbsp; Any avalanche on either weak layer will be large to very large and difficult to survive. Although snowpack test results were not impressive, similar layers of rounding facets and surface hoar in the Cascades have produced numerous avalanches in recent days, some of them human-triggered.

A weak snowpack will make managing terrain more difficult than you may be used to. Let the storm run its course by keeping away from all avalanche terrain.</span></p>",
    "hazard_discussion": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday should be a similar storm as Thursday night at Snoqualmie Pass, except lower freezing levels are expected and the bulk of the precipitation should come during the daylight hours, increasing the hazard throughout the day. On Friday, Alpental Patrol reported slabs as deep as 3 feet triggered during control work above the rain/snow line, while wet avalanches were triggered at lower elevations. Professionals in the Kendall area were able to verify the existence of our layers of concern and weak snow grains, which are driving the Persistent Slab problem. The two layers we are most concerned with are the 2/1 crust, which has weak snow above and below it. And the Mid-January Crust (1/13), which contains weak snow above it. Although these weak snow grains have shown signs of healing in recent days, they have also been the point of failure for multiple small avalanches.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we continue to receive new snow and wind, slab depth atop these weak layers will increase. Slopes that have reached their tipping point already could reload and produce another round of avalanches. More concerning may be slopes that have not yet reached their tipping point.&nbsp; Saturday's storm could be enough to finally tip the scales, producing large and deadly avalanches. Recent avalanches, persistent grains in the snowpack, strong winds, and heavy snow are all red flags informing you that the snowpack is unstable and needs time to heal. Continue to exercise patience and caution as this storm cycle plays out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, continue to follow the latest guidance from local, state, and federal health officials. Avoid unnecessary risks that could impact first responders and stress medical resources.&nbsp; Wear a mask when appropriate, practice social distancing, and consider recreating closer to home.</em></strong></span></p>",

    "hazard_discussion": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The past two weeks were very active in the West North zone with impressive storms, eye-opening avalanche cycles, and a few close calls. Avalanche conditions related to new snow and wind are concerning enough, and a lingering deep slab instability poses uncertainty and high consequences. Avoid avalanche terrain Saturday and be patient while the snowpack takes time to adjust and stabilize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning January 24, incremental loads of light snowfall buried a weak old snow surface (mid-January crust/facets) that formed during a prolonged period of cold, clear weather. Observations January 25-29 indicated the old snow surface to be problematic in isolated areas, but avalanches within new and wind drifted snow were more widespread. Heavy loading from new snow and wind January 30 - February 2 (4ft of snow/8.5in water at Heather Meadows) finally pushed the mid-January crust/facets to a tipping point and caused a natural cycle of deep slab avalanches large enough to destroy a house or break mature trees. With clear skies on February 3, many long time locals and professionals were able to document the aftermath, reporting avalanches in areas they had never seen run, and avalanche paths producing slides larger than they can remember. Several close calls also occurred including snowmobile triggered avalanches breaking 3ft+ thick and several hundred feet wide in Canyon Creek on February 3 (photo below), and very large natural avalanches on February 1 on Mt. Herman's east face hitting Bagley Creek with debris and powder clouds running uphill across the valley towards nearby skiers (video below).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, continue to follow the latest guidance from local, state, and federal health officials.

    "hazard_discussion": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The past two weeks were very active throughout the region with impressive storms, eye-opening avalanche cycles, and a few close calls.

Avoid avalanche terrain Saturday and be patient while the snowpack takes time to adjust and stabilize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning January 24, incremental loads of light snowfall buried a weak old snow surface (mid-January crust/facets) that formed during a prolonged period of cold, clear weather. Observations January 25-29 indicated the old snow surface to be problematic in isolated areas, but avalanches within new and wind drifted snow were more widespread. Heavy loading from new snow and wind January 30 - February 2 finally pushed the mid-January crust/facets to a tipping point and caused a natural cycle of deep slab avalanches large enough to destroy a house or break mature trees. With clear skies on February 3, many long time locals and professionals were able to document the aftermath, reporting avalanches in areas they had never seen run, and avalanche paths producing slides larger than they can remember. Several close calls also occurred in the West North zone including snowmobile triggered avalanches breaking 3ft+ thick and several hundred feet wide in Canyon Creek along Hwy 542 on February 3 (photo below), and very large natural avalanches on February 1 on Mt. Herman's east face hitting Bagley Creek with debris and powder clouds running uphill across the valley towards nearby skiers (video below).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, continue to follow the latest guidance from local, state, and federal health officials.

    "hazard_discussion": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike Thursday night&rsquo;s storm, this storm should drop the bulk of its precipitation during the daylight hours on Saturday, increasing the hazard throughout the day. There are currently two layers of concern in the upper snowpack. The Mid-January Crust (1/13) contains weak snow grains on top of the crust and has been the culprit for much of the avalanche activity in the past week in areas such as Crystal, Mt. Saint Helens, and White Pass. This layer could be around 3-4 feet deep in some locations. The 2/1 crust is a bit closer to the surface and may be found closer to 2 feet down, with weak snow above and possibly below it. Although these weak snow grains have shown signs of healing in some locations, they have been the point of failure for avalanches all week long (up to size D2.5) and are very much in play.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we continue to receive new snow and wind, slab depth atop these weak layers will increase. Slopes that have reached their tipping point already could reload and produce another round of avalanches. More concerning may be slopes that have not yet reached their tipping point. Those slopes could finally reach that point on Saturday, producing large and deadly avalanches. Recent avalanches, persistent grains in the snowpack, strong winds, and heavy snow are all red flags informing you that the snowpack is unstable and needs time to heal. Continue to exercise patience and caution as this storm cycle plays out by staying away from avalanche terrain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, continue to follow the latest guidance from local, state, and federal health officials.

Some of these slides were triggered from long distances away or stepped down into older, deeper layers of the snowpack. A weak snowpack structure has been observed throughout the zone, even in areas that have not yet produced these avalanches. There are currently two crusts within the snowpack that have weak snow grains sitting above or below them. With continued high precipitation rates on Saturday and more load added to stress these layers, we expect more of these scary and unpredictable avalanches to follow.

Snowfall is expected to increase throughout the day with a slight bit of warming in the afternoon hours. These fluctuating snow levels combined with strong winds should create multiple potential weak interfaces in the recent storm snow. Snowfall should be more significant on the volcanoes while winds should be more significant closer to the crest, creating a little variability. Regardless of where you find yourself, any avalanche failing on these layers could act as a trigger for those deeper persistent slabs. Even if you suspect that a persistent issue does not exist in your area, you should stay out of avalanche terrain as this storm runs its course.</span></p>",

Large, and often surprising avalanches have been occurring and may be triggered on a variety of weak layers even below treeline. Consider avoiding entire features in avalanche terrain, and stay alert to signs of instability such as shooting cracks and whumphs.</p>",
    "hazard_discussion": "<p>A large ski triggered avalanche was reported from the near treeline band on Friday, and folks reported several small wind slabs in steep terrain below cliff features in Cutthroat drainage. Professionals reported shooting cracks and propagation from steeper terrain as well. On Wednesday, strong sun appeared to have pushed the slopes in Portley Bowl over the edge and caused natural avalanches. This following a <a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210202_washington-pass-portley-bowl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ski triggered slab</a> in the bowl on Tuesday. A skier <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; color: #00364b; text-decoration-line: underline; outline: 0px;\" href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210202_confluence-early-winters-creek-cutthroat-creek/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">had a close call</a> on Tuesday near an area often thought of as 'safe' ski terrain. We suspect buried surface hoar as the culprit for these past two avalanches.</p>\n<p>Outside of wind-affected areas, you may find about 2ft of snow above the Jan 30th interface in the Washington Pass area. Another potential weak layer are small facets within, or <a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210204_silver-star-ck/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">above a crust</a> from mid-January. This prominent crust can be found about 3ft below the surface at mid and lower elevations.</p>\n<p>Further east in the zone, the weakened crust from mid-January has been a concern, even below treeline. Observers in the Twisp drainage reported collapsing at 4,800ft on a northeast aspect on Monday, and snowpack tests show potential for avalanches to propagate. Also on Monday, a<a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210201_lost-river-valley-near-mazama/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> large avalanche</a> was heard in the Lost River drainage following a period of warming and light to moderate precipitation. To sum it up, we have higher uncertainty with the shallower and weaker snowpack in the eastern part of the zone. If you travel to areas such as the Chelan-Sawtooth Mountains, Twisp River, and Chewuch drainages, take time to dig in the snow and look for older weak layers. You'll need to evaluate the upper snowpack carefully to travel safely in avalanche terrain no matter where you go on Saturday!</p>\n<p><strong><em>During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, continue to follow the latest guidance from local, state, and federal health officials. Avoid unnecessary risks that could impact first responders and stress medical resources. Wear a mask when appropriate, practice social distancing, and consider recreating closer to home.</em></strong></p>",

The storm will favor areas closer to the crest such as the Salmon la Sac, but won't produce as much snow as last weekend's storms for places like the Wenatchee Mountains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Observers reported a natural D2 avalanche on an east aspect at 5,500ft west of Blewett Pass on Friday. This appeared to have run on the deeper crust from mid-January. On Thursday, a snowboarder <a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210204_in-bounds-mission-ridge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">took a ride</a> with a wind slab at Mission Ridge on a Northwest aspect in the Near Treeline elevation band.

On Wednesday, </span>Mission Ridge Ski Patrol reported 4 large hard slab avalanches with control work. These likely ran on the crust from 1/13, and were roughly 24\"+ deep x 100ft wide in ridgetop, or near ridgetop terrain. Whumphing collapses such as the ones I experienced in low angle terrain near the summit of Mt Lillian on <a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210202_blewett-pass-mt-lillian/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tuesday</a> continue to tell us that deeper weak layers are primed to avalanche. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In all parts of the zone, weak structure can be observed in the top 2-3 feet of the snowpack, and could result in an avalanche. These include facets resting on a crust from mid-January, or a sandwich of crusts from that same time. At lower elevations, you'll find less new snow and a stronger recent rain crust.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, continue to follow the latest guidance from local, state, and federal health officials.

The Wenatchee Mountains east of Hwy 97 will continue to have these dangerous conditions as well. When the snowpack is this complex, keep your terrain choices simple. Elevations below 4,500ft may offer significantly lower chances of triggering one of these.</span></p>",

    "hazard_discussion": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;A moderate storm impacted the East South area, with significant winds and a few inches of new snow Friday--a pattern that will repeat Saturday. You could trigger avalanches in places where the winds drift the snow into deeper slabs. Blowing snow may serve as your simplest observations to identify wind loaded slopes. Drifts behind objects and changes in the depth of soft snow may also help you pick out potential trouble spots. Strong westerly winds could form slabs on exposed features at any elevation.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We don&rsquo;t know much about the snowpack structure of the East South area. However, all other zones in the Washington Cascades show persistent slabs in their forecasts (<a href=\"https://nwac.us/avalanche-forecast/#/west-slopes-south\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">West South Forecast</a>, <a href=\"https://nwac.us/avalanche-forecast/#/east-slopes-central\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">East Central Forecast</a>). A safe bet will be to assume that persistent weak layers exist at least in some parts of this region too. In most areas, weak facets sit above a very thick and prominent mid-Janurary crust (1/13). These sugary grains failed in avalanches in both adjacent zones (East Central and West South). While you can use snow profiles and snowpack tests to find and monitor these layers, don&rsquo;t risk your life based on one hole in the snow. Avalanches are most likely to fail on persistent grains underneath wind loaded pockets. As a result, give all steep wind-loaded slopes a very wide berth. If you dig in the snow, help us find and track these potentially dangerous layers by </span><a href=\"https://nwac.us/observations/submit/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">submitting an observation.&nbsp;</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At lower elevations, a thin snowpack still exists in many locations.

Wind typically transports snow from the upwind sides of terrain features and deposits snow on the downwind side. Wind slabs are often smooth and rounded and sometimes sound hollow, and can range from soft to hard. Wind slabs that form over a persistent weak layer (surface hoar, depth hoar, or near-surface facets) may be termed Persistent Slabs or may develop into Persistent Slabs.",
