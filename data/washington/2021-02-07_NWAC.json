These grains are sitting atop a stout crust and are driving our Persistent Slab problem. The Mid-January crust/facet combo should be around 35 inches down from the surface and easily identifiable. Weak grains may not exist in all locations, but where they do, we have the 3 elements needed for slab avalanches: a slab, weak layer, and bedsurface. How reactive and widespread this setup is remains a question to be answered, but for now, consider dialing back your terrain choices from what you may normally pursue at Moderate danger. Look for those red flag signs of instability, such as shooting cracks and whumpfing collapses as indicators that you could be dealing with a persistent weak layer. And take some time to dig down to the crust, perform some tests and look for the existence of weak snow grains. If you do not find them, you should not immediately rule out their existence. You should continue to collect more information and ease into terrain.

Look for Wind Slabs near rocky features such as gullies and cliffs, on convex rollovers, or on leeward slopes near ridgelines. Slabs may increase in size and reactivity as you ascend in elevation. In some areas, slabs may have multiple density changes from the past few days to fail on. You should use test slopes to check the recent storm snow to see how it reacts to your weight. As you travel, quick hand pits, upslope tests, or visual clues such as textured surfaces, smooth pillow-like piles of snow, or fresh cornices can help give you clues to the distribution and reactivity of wind-affected features to steer around.</span></p>",

Weak snow sitting atop the Mid-January crust is showing signs of healing, but we are not out of the woods yet. Persistent Slabs do not heal quickly, are difficult to predict, and can break in surprising ways. Surprising avalanches have been easily triggered, propagated widely, and ran quickly, throughout the Olympics and the Cascades since this layer has been buried. Triggering a smaller avalanche in wind-loaded terrain on Sunday could allow a step-down to these persistent layers, creating larger and more dangerous avalanches. If you notice red-flag signs of instability such as shooting cracks or whumpfing collapses as you travel or find persistent grains in your snowpits, put plenty of space between yourself and slopes 30 degrees and steeper.</span></p>",

Obvious signs of avalanche danger include cracks shooting through the snow, whumphing collapses, and recent avalanches. The best way to stay safe is to avoid open slopes steeper than 30 degrees and put a large buffer of terrain between where you travel and all avalanche paths. Make sure to regroup and stop only in truly safe terrain, well away from and out from under steeper slopes. You may be able to trigger these avalanches from a long distance away. Triggering avalanches is likely on recently wind loaded slopes, and they may be especially reactive on southerly slopes that are typically sun-exposed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;About 2-3 feet below the snow surface, you can find a softer layer of snow above a crust formed in mid-January. On Friday, observers confirmed avalanches that broke widely and were remotely triggered on this layer. This snowpack structure can be found on most slopes, and there's uncertainty around how widespread these avalanches will be in the terrain. To be safe, approach any slope steeper than 30 degrees with extreme caution. When in doubt, avoid avalanche terrain.</p>",

    "hazard_discussion": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We do not expect a widespread natural avalanche cycle on Sunday, which has allowed us to drop the hazard to Considerable. However, there is some uncertainty around a convergence zone setting up, weak grains in the snowpack, recent avalanches, strong winds, and recent significant snowfall. These all point toward unstable conditions at Snoqualmie Pass and are enough to have us on edge. Do not be surprised if you come across some natural avalanches on Sunday, particularly during periods of intense precipitation. Human triggered avalanches are likely to occur. If convergence does set up over the zone, there could be longer or more frequent periods of intense precipitation, potentially driving higher avalanche danger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The weak layers in the snowpack have been well tested the past few days, but due to the storm, observations have been limited and we cannot relay confidently what happened out there. All we can say for sure is that these weak layers continue to be positively identified by professionals throughout the zone and that they can create unpredictable avalanches that break in surprising ways. On Thursday, widespread small natural avalanches occurred at Snoqualmie Pass on the 2/1 crust. The Mid-January (1/13) crust/facet combo has yet to have any confirmed avalanches on it at Snoqualmie Pass but has been the culprit for multiple large avalanches throughout the Cascades over the past week. On Friday, Alpental Pro Patrol triggered a large avalanche on what is suspected to be the Mid-January crust in non-skier compacted terrain. This avalanche reportedly broke more widely and ran further than it has in close to a decade. All of this information should lead you to approach the mountains with caution if you choose to head out on Sunday. Do not get lulled into your standard method of approaching Snoqualmie Pass storms, and dial back your terrain choices from what you may normally pursue at Considerable danger. If you do head out, be conservative and let us know what you see by <a href=\"https://nwac.us/observations/submit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">submitting a public observation</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, continue to follow the latest guidance from local, state, and federal health officials.

Precipitation should continue Saturday night into Sunday as freezing levels lower and strong winds persist, building slabs. These slabs may be larger and more reactive as you ascend in elevation or in locations where the wind has aided in their development. Look for multiple density breaks in the storm snow due to fluctuating freezing levels, wind, and different periods of precipitation intensity. You can use hand-pits, test slopes, or up-slope tests to check these density breaks for potential points of failure, or to see how the recent storm snow is reacting to your weight. This won&rsquo;t tell you the whole story, though. You will need to dig to see how these slabs are affecting those deeper persistent weak layers.

As storms continue to impact the pass, these layers are getting buried deeper in the snowpack, making any potential avalanche involving them large and potentially deadly. Triggering a smaller storm slab or wind-affected pocket in the upper snowpack could cause the snow to step down to these weak layers, creating destructive avalanches. Digging down to identify the weak snowpack structure in the area you are traveling can help you identify the potential for Persistent Slabs. But if you don&rsquo;t find weak snow grains, don&rsquo;t immediately rule these slabs out. Continue to gather more information and ease into terrain slowly.&nbsp;</span></p>",

    "hazard_discussion": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The past two weeks were very active in the West North zone with impressive storms, eye-opening avalanche cycles, and a few close calls. Avalanche conditions related to new snow and wind are concerning enough, and a lingering deep slab instability poses uncertainty and high consequences. Although the likelihood of natural avalanches decreased, dangerous and unusual conditions still linger. The recent storm snow needs time to settle and stabilize, and deeper weak layers will require patience and a very conservative mindset. <strong>Only simple, low angle terrain is appropriate at this time.&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning January 24, incremental loads of light snowfall buried a weak old snow surface (mid-January crust/facets) that formed during a prolonged period of cold, clear weather. Observations January 25-29 indicated the old snow surface to be problematic in isolated areas, but avalanches within new and wind drifted snow were more widespread. Heavy loading from new snow and wind January 30 - February 2 (4ft of snow/8.5in water at Heather Meadows) finally pushed the mid-January crust/facets to a tipping point and caused a natural cycle of deep slab avalanches large enough to destroy a house or break mature trees. With clear skies on February 3, many long time locals and professionals were able to document the aftermath, reporting avalanches in areas they had never seen run, and avalanche paths producing slides larger than they can remember. Several close calls also occurred including snowmobile triggered avalanches breaking 3ft+ thick and several hundred feet wide in Canyon Creek on February 3 (photo below), and very large natural avalanches on February 1 on Mt. Herman's east face hitting Bagley Creek with debris and powder clouds running uphill across the valley towards nearby skiers (video below).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, continue to follow the latest guidance from local, state, and federal health officials.

    "hazard_discussion": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The past two weeks were very active throughout the region with impressive storms, eye-opening avalanche cycles, and a few close calls. Avalanche conditions related to new snow and wind are concerning enough, and a lingering deep slab instability poses uncertainty and high consequences. Although the likelihood of natural avalanches decreased, dangerous and unusual conditions still linger. The recent storm snow needs time to settle and stabilize, and deeper weak layers will require patience and a very conservative mindset. <strong>Only simple, low angle terrain is appropriate at this time.</strong> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning January 24, incremental loads of light snowfall buried a weak old snow surface (mid-January crust/facets) that formed during a prolonged period of cold, clear weather. Observations January 25-29 indicated the old snow surface to be problematic in isolated areas, but avalanches within new and wind drifted snow were more widespread. Heavy loading from new snow and wind January 30 - February 2 (4ft of snow/8.5in water at Heather Meadows) finally pushed the mid-January crust/facets to a tipping point and caused a natural cycle of deep slab avalanches large enough to destroy a house or break mature trees. With clear skies on February 3, many long time locals and professionals were able to document the aftermath, reporting avalanches in areas they had never seen run, and avalanche paths producing slides larger than they can remember. Several close calls occurred in the neighboring West North zone including snowmobile triggered avalanches breaking 3ft+ thick and several hundred feet wide in Canyon Creek on February 3 (photo below), and very large natural avalanches on February 1 on Mt. Herman's east face hitting Bagley Creek with debris and powder clouds running uphill across the valley towards nearby skiers (video below).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, continue to follow the latest guidance from local, state, and federal health officials.

Although this slope was wind-affected, it is believed that the slab broke on the Mid-January (1/13) crust/facet combo which has been the culprit of avalanches across the West South for the past week and a half. The fact that we continue to see avalanches on this layer should continue to remind you that it is not going away quickly and that these avalanches are unpredictable and dangerous. They can be remotely triggered from long distances away, break easily, propagate widely, and run quickly. The main weak layer is now 3 or more feet deep in most locations and this weak snowpack structure has been positively identified throughout the zone. In some areas, a second weak layer exists 2 feet or more down from the surface. Give all slopes 30 degrees or greater a wide berth as we navigate this tricky snowpack.</span></p>",

These slabs may have multiple density breaks within them due to fluctuation freezing levels, wind, and different periods of precipitation intensity. Take a look at these density breaks to see which ones could be a point of failure in your area. You can use test slopes, upslope tests, or hand-pits as you travel to give you quick information, but you will need to dig to get the full picture about how these slabs are interacting with the persistent weak layers. Triggering one of these slabs on Sunday could cause a ripple effect where the slab steps-down to trigger those persistent weak layers, creating larger and more destructive avalanches. If you find instabilities during your testing or notice fresh/recent avalanches, avoid terrain 30 degrees and steeper.</span></p>",

It will be easy to trigger avalanches near and above treeline where the wind drifts stiff slabs of snow. You may be able to trigger large and surprising avalanches on older weak layers of snow.&nbsp;</p>",
    "hazard_discussion": "<p>On Saturday, a skier intentionally triggered a small wind slab on a cross-loaded southwest slope at 7400ft near Washington Pass. On Friday, a large ski triggered avalanche was reported near treeline along with several small wind slabs in steep terrain below cliff features in Cutthroat drainage. Professionals reported shooting cracks and propagation from steeper terrain, as well. On Wednesday, we believe that a significant portion of Portley Bowl avalanched naturally following a <a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210202_washington-pass-portley-bowl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ski triggered slab</a> on a smaller part of the bowl on Tuesday. A skier <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; color: #00364b; text-decoration-line: underline; outline: 0px;\" href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210202_confluence-early-winters-creek-cutthroat-creek/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">had a close call</a> on Tuesday near an area often thought of as 'safe' ski terrain. We suspect buried surface hoar as the culprit for these past two avalanches.</p>\n<p>Outside of wind-affected areas, you may find about 2-3ft of snow above the Jan 30th interface in the Washington Pass area. Another potential weak layer are small facets within, or <a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210204_silver-star-ck/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">above a crust</a> from mid-January. This prominent crust can be found about 3ft below the surface at mid and lower elevations.</p>\n<p>Further east in the zone, the weakened crust from mid-January has been a concern, even below treeline. Observers in the Twisp drainage reported collapsing at 4,800ft on a northeast aspect on Monday, and snowpack tests show potential for avalanches to propagate. Also on Monday, a<a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210201_lost-river-valley-near-mazama/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> large avalanche</a> was heard in the Lost River drainage following a period of warming and light to moderate precipitation. To sum it up, we have higher uncertainty with the shallower and weaker snowpack in the eastern part of the zone. If you travel to areas such as the Chelan-Sawtooth Mountains, Twisp River, and Chewuch drainages, take time to dig in the snow and look for older weak layers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, continue to follow the latest guidance from local, state, and federal health officials. Avoid unnecessary risks that could impact first responders and stress medical resources. Wear a mask when appropriate, practice social distancing, and consider recreating closer to home.</em></strong></p>",

Surface hoar tends to survive in open, sheltered, and shaded terrain, but may be difficult to identify. Use snowpits and snowpack tests to look for weak layers and carefully evaluate the snowpack. Further east, you may be able to trigger avalanches on older, weak facets above or between crusts from mid-January. Both of these weak layers can be found 2-3 feet below the surface.

    "hazard_discussion": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several storms with strong W winds and light amounts of new snow Thursday night / Friday and again Saturday / Sunday continue to build small-large slabs onto lee slopes that you can trigger. Due to the strength of the winds, slabs may form well below ridgecrest.&nbsp; New wind-transported snow may rest on a&nbsp; thin temperature crust that likely formed up to 6000-7000 ft during a period of sun and warm temperatures on Friday. Blowing snow should continue to serve as your simplest observations to identify wind loaded slopes. Drifts behind objects and changes in the depth of soft snow may also help you pick out potential trouble spots. Be suspicious of mid-slope terrain features and cross-loaded gullies or terrain traps where snow may accumulate. Avoid wind-loaded slopes steeper than 35 degrees at all elevations, recognizing that slab avalanches will be larger, more dangerous, and more widespread as you ascend to higher elevations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We don&rsquo;t know much about the snowpack structure of the East South area. However, all other zones in the Washington Cascades show persistent slabs in their forecasts (e.g. <a href=\"https://nwac.us/avalanche-forecast/#/west-slopes-south\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">West South Forecast</a>, <a href=\"https://nwac.us/avalanche-forecast/#/east-slopes-central\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">East Central Forecast</a>). A safe bet will be to assume that persistent weak layers exist at least in some parts of this region too. In most areas, weak facets sit above a very thick and prominent mid-Janurary crust (1/13). These sugary grains failed in avalanches in both adjacent zones (East Central and West South). While you can use snow profiles and snowpack tests to find and monitor these layers, don&rsquo;t risk your life based on one hole in the snow. Avalanches are most likely to fail on persistent grains underneath wind loaded pockets. As a result, give all steep wind-loaded slopes a very wide berth. If you dig in the snow, help us find and track these potentially dangerous layers by </span><a href=\"https://nwac.us/observations/submit/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">submitting an observation.&nbsp;</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At lower elevations, a thin snowpack still exists in many locations. Shallowly buried obstacles, open creeks, and bare ground may block your path. The snowpack should increase dramatically as you ascend in elevation and get closer to the Cascade crest.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, continue to follow the latest guidance from local, state, and federal health officials.

Around 4-5\" of fresh snow with cooling temperatures will add ammunition for the winds to load lee slopes.&nbsp; </span>Typical start zones may be wind-swept, but other areas will have wind deposits, potentially far down the slope.&nbsp; Wind slabs are likely to be large and firm, making them difficult to escape because they break widely across a terrain feature, while soft snow may have an upside-down layering structure making it easier to trigger. Seek wind-sheltered terrain where possible. Pay attention to cracking snow surfaces and firm, punchy layering. Treat active snow transport and wind-loading as warning signs. Avoid wind-loaded slopes steeper than 35 degrees, especially midslope convexities,&nbsp; and shallow ridges.</p>\n<p>Below treeline, slabs may be smaller, softer, and easier to steer around. Steer around lens-shaped pockets where you can trigger an avalanche on slopes steeper than 35 degrees.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Wind typically transports snow from the upwind sides of terrain features and deposits snow on the downwind side. Wind slabs are often smooth and rounded and sometimes sound hollow, and can range from soft to hard. Wind slabs that form over a persistent weak layer (surface hoar, depth hoar, or near-surface facets) may be termed Persistent Slabs or may develop into Persistent Slabs.",
