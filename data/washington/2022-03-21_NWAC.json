    "hazard_discussion": "<p>Avalanche concerns on Monday will be a tossup between new storm and wind slabs first thing in the morning and wet loose avalanches triggered by warming and rainfall in the afternoon. Expect snow levels to shoot up to Olympus-like heights by day&rsquo;s end.</p>\n<p>Winds overnight will continue to strip away any snow that remains for transport on windward slopes. A few inches of new snow near and above treeline will add more raw material to build new wind slabs as well. Look for scoured snow surfaces, slabby-looking drifts, cornice features, and changes in snow texture - pay attention to these and other clues to identify and avoid places where shallow but unstable wind slabs might lurk.</p>\n<p>As snow levels rise and snow turns to rain look for signs of instability like rollerballs, pinwheels, and very small wet loose avalanches. Even slopes with only 3&rdquo; to 6&rdquo; of dry new snow still have enough to produce small wet avalanches once the surface becomes wet and loses cohesion. Move off and away from steep terrain when you observe the beginnings of wet avalanche activity and pay particular attention to terrain overhead.</p>\n<p>On Saturday Olympic National Park rangers reported boot top, unconsolidated new snow on sheltered aspects with 3&rdquo; of wind affected snow over crust on southerly, windward slopes. The new snow was generally well bonded but very steep test slopes still produced shallow slabs. One small natural avalanche was observed in wind loaded terrain below a cornice in Maggies on an east aspect at 5400&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>2021-22 Forecast Schedule: Avalanche danger ratings will be issued for the Olympics every Friday through Sunday and during mid-week holidays. During the week when the Hurricane Ridge road is closed, forecast information will be updated daily to include expected conditions and relevant travel advice under the No Rating label.</p>",

    "bottom_line": "<p>Heads up Monday: Expect a stormy, dynamic, and ultimately dangerous day. New snow, rain, and warming temperatures are expected to increase avalanche danger at all elevations. You could easily trigger storm and loose wet avalanches. Avalanches could be large and surprising above 5,500ft, where buried wind slabs and persistent weak layers may fail.&nbsp;</p>",
    "hazard_discussion": "<p>Expect a significant increase in avalanche danger from Sunday to Monday, as a warm front sends snow levels to 5,000ft during the daytime and creates dangerous conditions. Conditions should be dynamic, and what you find first thing in the morning may be much different a few hours later. With the weather forecast models uncertain on how this storm will play out, the avalanche forecast is uncertain. High avalanche danger may occur if the storm shifts a little further to the east, so the forecast may be updated by 0700 on Monday morning. In either case, expect dangerous conditions with good chances for natural avalanches to run.</p>\n<p>On Sunday observers triggered small windslab avalanches in the new snow, and small loose avalanches on steep features facing the sun. We've also been tracking a layer of faceted grains just above a crust from early March. Observers in the <a class=\"afp-html-a\" href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/12853/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chiwaukum range</a> consistently found the March 8th facets above 5,000ft and reported significant wind loading on Saturday. On Friday, <a href=\"https://nwac.us/pro-obs/20220318_jim-hill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">forecasters on Jim Hill</a> and in the <a href=\"https://nwac.us/pro-obs/20220318_whitepine-road/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">White Pine drainage</a> confirmed the presence of the 3/8 facets and test results that indicate they could produce slab avalanches. See images and videos below. The layer could produce surprising avalanches where it exists under drifted slabs and may get overloaded with the storm on Monday. You can find the weak layer 2-3 feet below the surface on NW-NE aspects above 5,500ft.&nbsp; Elsewhere in the Cascades, this layer has produced very large slab avalanches, and it may just be a matter of time in the Stevens Pass zone.</p>",

With conditions like this, chose plans that give you lots of options to easily identify avalanche terrain and avoid it if needed. There is quite a bit of uncertainty in how much precipitation Snoqualmie could receive Monday. If more water falls than expected, natural avalanches could be larger and more widespread. You&rsquo;d need to respond by quickly avoiding all avalanche terrain.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If all these weather factors weren&rsquo;t enough, the snowpack contains several snow layers that could also fail under the new snow/rain load. A layer of graupel fell during the storm on 3/19. These BB-like grains often produce avalanches even after a storm ends. They may be found just below the snow from the last 24 hrs. Deeper in the snowpack, a layer of weak facets sit over a very thick and stout crust on NW-NE aspects near and above treelines. This layer is likely 3 ft or more deep. So far, only one small avalanche has been reported on this layer in the zone. However, it's hard to say how they&rsquo;ll react to this additional load.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At lower elevations travel continues to be difficult.

It was still possible to get deep cracking in storm slab layers on unsupported slopes but the slabs were too well bonded below. Light density new snow overnight had begun to fill in the many crowns from the avalanche cycle on Saturday and strengthening winds in the afternoon had begun to transport snow and finish smoothing things out. Observers on the west side Table Mountain saw no new deep slab avalanches in alpine terrain. Though a single observation in one drainage does not cancel out the deep persistent avalanche problem, it is the first sign that the big avalanches last week may have been one-off events.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Satruday's storm delivered more snow than expected in a very short period of time. Avalanche danger exceeded the forecast across West North - especially in the period from sunrise to about noon. Heather Meadows picked up about 1.5&rdquo; of precipitation in 12 hours with other areas like Schriebers seeing similar accumulations (and avalanche activity). Snow doesn&rsquo;t like rapid change - if it gets too warm or too much load too quickly it acts out. Despite limited visibility through the morning, many of the observed avalanches were impressive. They were not necessarily deep (most were 30cm or less, slightly deeper in wind loaded terrain) and the ones that could be seen were D2 in size or less. On the other hand, some propagated very wide with crowns wrapping around terrain features in ways not normally seen. Slopes that did not avalanche naturally were easy to trigger with a few kicks from lower angle terrain above.&nbsp;</p>",

An additional factor is a sharp rise in snow levels that could create prominent strong over weak layering as heavy, wet snow falls on colder and drier snow below. Note changes in texture, depth, and layering for the whole of the day - not just when you first get on the snow. Approach steeper terrain features with caution and plan on scaling back to simpler, lower angle, as the storm slabs become touchy and easy to trigger. If there is more snow than forecast and you start seeing widespread human triggered and even natural avalanche activity, assume a higher level of danger and simply avoid avalanche terrain.

Approach steeper terrain features with caution and plan on scaling back to simpler, lower angle, as the storm slabs become touchy and easy to trigger. If there is more snow than forecast and you start seeing widespread human triggered and even natural avalanche activity, assume a higher level of danger and simply avoid avalanche terrain.

As the layer in question gets buried deeper, triggering one of these avalanches is more difficult. With the end of heavy snowfall, it's less likely one will release naturally - but it could still happen. A large load like a cornice fall, smaller avalanche initiating in higher terrain, or a group of people on a slope could trigger one where a single person might not. This isn&rsquo;t really a &ldquo;manageable&rdquo; avalanche problem that can be figured out and mitigated with snowpits and other assessment tools.

Choose terrain that lets you easily identify avalanche terrain, and quickly reduce your exposure as conditions change. This includes making sure you have a safe route back to the trailhead if things become more dangerous than expected. Some uncertainty exists around how much precipitation most areas of the West South zone will receive. If more water falls than expected, natural avalanches could become much larger and more common creating locally very dangerous conditions.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We expect the volcanoes to take the brunt of this storm. Even though that may mean less snow near the Crest, given the presence of a persistent slab issue, you&rsquo;ll likely still encounter potentially dangerous conditions. Over the past several days human triggered avalanches and audible whumpfs have been observed across the West South zone. A layer of sugary facets just above the Early March Crust has been the culprit in all of these events. In most locations this layer is now 2-3 ft below the surface. While this may make it harder to trigger and avalanche could easily be big enough to bury and kill you. Unfortunately, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of ways to easily rule this avalanche issue out. Tracks on a slope and a few snowpack tests do not mean its safe. Best to just give this hard to manage problem the respect it deserves.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At lower elevations, less snow will limit the size of avalanches. Instead you may find sticky snow, firm rough surface, open creeks, and piles of avalanche debris. </span></p>",

Keep wind slabs, storm slabs, and loose avalanches all on your radar as the day progresses. Avalanches in older, deeply buried layers are difficult to trigger, but the weak structure remains.</p>",
    "hazard_discussion": "<p>Monday should be a dynamic day, with the nice cold snow slowly turning to heavier, moist snow in many areas by the end of the day. The real warmup may hold off until later in the evening or Tuesday for this zone, however. In any case, expect changing conditions. If you find more than 6\" of new snow and widespread storm-related instabilities, conditions are dangerous so adjust your travels accordingly.&nbsp; Observers reported a handful of small (D1) wind slab avalanches in alpine and treeline terrain on Sunday, and one small (D1) loose wet avalanche below treeline near Cutthroat. On Saturday, observers triggered loose snow avalanches and a small wind slab avalanche on a northeast aspect near Harts Pass. The storm of the 14-15th delivered over 1-2 feet and brought an <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://nwac.us/pro-obs/20220315_kangaroo-ridge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">active day</a>&nbsp;of natural and&nbsp;<a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/12615/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">triggered avalanches. </a>On wind-sheltered NW-NE aspects near and above treeline, you can find a thin layer of near-surface facets 1-2 feet below the surface and often on a crust. This layer (buried on March 8th in other zones) has been the source of impressively dangerous persistent slab avalanches near the Mount Baker ski area and other parts of the Cascades.</p>\n<p>A deeper persistent weak layer exists in the zone. The layer can still be found about 3 feet deep, sandwiched between eroding crusts on NW-NE aspects near and above treeline, and has been particularly problematic in the Harts Pass area. The most recent of these was triggered on March 9th in Allen Basin. While triggering an avalanche on this layer (the late January facets) is unlikely, the consequences could be serious. You can limit your exposure to shallow, rocky areas, and very steep and unsupported slopes. After a widespread avalanche cycle on 2/28-3/1, observers reported a number of deep crowns and avalanches throughout the zone that likely ran on the weak layer.

A warming trend with the snowfall may create shallow storm slab instabilities during the day, especially in areas further west in the zone. Keep abreast of the changing conditions, and look for signs of instability as the day progresses. Look for shooting cracks in wind-thickened snow, shallow and soft storm slabs on steep convex rolls, and recent avalanche activity.</p>\n<p class=\"afp-html-p\">Use the most caution on leeward sides of ridges and terrain features. Steer around convex roll-overs and slopes 35 degrees and steeper where you see evidence of drifting. Some shaded, northerly aspects near and above treeline may still harbor old, buried wind slab that could break more deeply on faceted layers. Cornices are also growing, so attempt to minimize your time underneath the honkers as warming temperatures may make them more unstable.</p>",

You could easily trigger storm, wind and loose wet avalanches. Avalanches could be large and surprising at upper elevations where buried wind slabs, and persistent weak layers may fail.</p>",
    "hazard_discussion": "<p>Expect a significant increase in avalanche danger from Sunday to Monday, as a warm front sends snow levels to 5,000ft during the daytime and creates dangerous conditions. Conditions should be dynamic, and what you find first thing in the morning may be much different a few hours later. Expect dangerous conditions with good chances for natural avalanches to run, especially at upper elevations and near the crest.</p>\n<p>Observers have been documenting weaker, faceted grains and/or surface hoar overlying a crust from early March on NW-NE aspects from <a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/12856/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stemilt Basin</a> to <a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/12697/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Icicle Creek</a>.

A vague observation of large collapses in the Teanaway also came in from Saturday (unknown details). By Monday, there may be well over 2 ft of snow overlying these persistent weak layers at upper elevations on northern and eastern aspects. It appears likely that this storm could increase chances of triggering avalanches on this deeper layer, so Monday is a heads-up day.</p>",

Rounding facets were identified overlying the Early March Crust, which was buried about 11-15 inches deep. Both natural and human-triggered avalanches were observed that failed on this layer 3/16-17. Although avalanche activity on this layer so far seems to be isolated to areas where the wind has drifted the snow into deeper slabs, it could become a more widespread problem with dynamic weather over the next 48 hours bringing wind, snow, rain, and rising temperatures.</p>\n<p>The East South zone is certainly not breaking any records for snowpack depths this winter. The warm temperatures associated with recent storms kept snow accumulations minimal at elevations below 6000ft. Below treeline areas have very little or no snowpack and many southerly aspects are melted out to ridgetops. Utilizing roads and summer trails to access higher elevations with a more robust snowpack is the best option. Travel cautiously, especially at lower elevations, to avoid impacts with rocks or stumps, and beware of open creeks.</p>",

Observations of avalanche activity suggest that the sensitivity of this layer may vary significantly throughout the terrain. Therefore, adjacent slopes may react differently, and it may not be the first person on the slope who triggers an avalanche. Be sure to dig down around 1ft to assess how the recent snow is bonded to the underlying crust looking for easy or sudden failures.

This may create an up-side-down layering, forming a fresh crop of reactive wind slabs, and thickening existing slabs from the weekend. The largest and most dangerous wind slabs will exist at upper elevations, particularly on easterly aspects. Cornices loom as well and could fall on slopes below acting as huge triggers. With all the recent wind, you may even find unstable wind drifted snow in open start zones below treeline. Look and feel for changes in snow surface texture and hardness as you move through terrain. Be leery of cornices, areas near rocks and cliffs, and the lee sides of gullies and ridgelines. Seek out supported terrain features and slopes sheltered from the wind to avoid the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

Wind typically transports snow from the upwind sides of terrain features and deposits snow on the downwind side. Wind slabs are often smooth and rounded and sometimes sound hollow, and can range from soft to hard. Wind slabs that form over a persistent weak layer (surface hoar, depth hoar, or near-surface facets) may be termed Persistent Slabs or may develop into Persistent Slabs.",

As the cold dry snow from the weekend gets wet, it will rapidly lose strength with increasing potential for wet avalanches. These conditions may not develop until late in the day, but elevated danger should continue overnight and into Tuesday as freezing levels skyrocket.&nbsp; There is some uncertainty whether wet avalanche activity will peak with the rain late Monday, or with 9000ft freezing levels and strong March sun Tuesday. Regardless, we expect widespread wet avalanches over the next 48 hours. Give the snowpack time to adjust and choose conservative terrain if you're caught out in the rain.</p>",
