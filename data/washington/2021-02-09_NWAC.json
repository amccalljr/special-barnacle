Given the uncertainty and the relatively higher reactiveness of these layers across the Sound, practice extra caution over this time.&nbsp; Persistent slabs can break widely around terrain features.

        "discussion": "<p>Deep persistent slab avalanches are difficult to manage and can catch even experienced travelers by surprise. The best way to stay safe is to avoid large, open slopes 35 degrees and steeper especially where wind loading has occurred. Put a large buffer of terrain between where you travel and all avalanche paths. Make sure to regroup and stop only in truly safe terrain, well away from and out from under steeper slopes. You may be able to trigger these avalanches from a long distance away. While these avalanches may be less likely below treeline, there's uncertainty and the snowpack structure can be found in open terrain above 4,000ft. These avalanches give little warning before releasing. To be safe, approach any slope steeper than 35 degrees with extreme caution. When in doubt, avoid avalanche terrain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;A widespread cycle of slab avalanches ran on persistent weak layers from Friday through Sunday. Observers confirmed avalanches that broke widely and were remotely triggered on this layer,<a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210207_jim-hill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> including an avalanche burial, resulting in no injuries on Jim Hill</a>. About 3-4 feet below the surface, you can find a softer layer of weak faceted snow above or around a crust that formed in mid-January. Sudden and propagating snowpack tests on this layer can indicate the potential for an avalanche.</p>",

Deep Persistent Slabs are typically hard to trigger, are very destructive and dangerous due to the large mass of snow involved, and can persist for months once developed.

One snow biker was partially buried and able to dig himself out. The other rider is fully buried and hasn&rsquo;t been recovered. Search and rescue operations are ongoing. &nbsp; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The avalanche occurred on a north aspect at 4400 ft in the Knox Creek drainage. This terrain lies in NWAC&rsquo;s East Central forecast zone. At least 8 other large avalanches were observed in the area. The other avalanches likely released within the last day or two. Initial avalanche classification: HS-AV-R3-D3-O.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">--------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s deep out there right now at Snoqualmie Pass. Do not ignore the large snow totals and relatively cold weather we are experiencing. The cold weather will not help the snowpack to heal as quickly as you may be used to, and persistent weak layers heal even more slowly than standard storm instabilities. If you choose to travel in the mountains, make conservative terrain choices, being aware of the high consequence slides that are possible on those deeper layers. With so much snow, loose snow can have consequences if they&rsquo;re able to knock you off your feet near small terrain traps, or even if you fall and are unable to get up. Learn more about snow immersion hazard <a href=\"https://deepsnowsafety.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A little bit of visibility on Monday gave us the ability to look around the Alpental Valley a bit. Large avalanches were observed to have run on Chair Peak with fresh debris down by Source Lake.&nbsp; On Sunday, Alpental Pro Patrol reported a very active day with slabs as deep as 5 feet being triggered during control work. After receiving reports of a <a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210206_easton/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">full burial</a> on the eastern edge of our zone on Saturday, a large avalanche incident occurred on Sunday at <a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210207_jim-hill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stevens Pass</a>. This should be a free lesson to those traveling at Snoqualmie Pass since the snowpack setup between the two zones is similar right now.

This snow is the result of a series of storms that had different freezing levels, wind speeds, and even precipitation types. The storm parade finished cold, delivering light fluffy snow. This is what you will encounter near the surface, and could drive loose avalanche problems, particularly on steeper terrain features. As you dig deeper, you&rsquo;ll find multiple interstorm layers, density breaks, and slabs to be concerned with. Take a look at which layers are reactive and how deep they are. You can use test slopes, hand pits, or uptrack tests to see if there is slab potential in the uppermost snowpack where you are traveling. You are going to have to dig to look at what layers are under the low-density snow. Avalanches will be more likely to be triggered near rocky terrain like the base of cliffs or gullies, on convex features, or steep slopes that are greater than 35 degrees. </span></p>",

The most likely places for these slides to run are large open terrain features over 30 degrees, with a higher likelihood as you ascend in elevation. We have some uncertainty about what it would take to trigger one of these slides at this point, but it could be a step down from a Storm Slab avalanche, a snowmobile, cornice, or even just a shallower spot in the snowpack.

There are many reports of avalanches failing on this layer in the last two weeks. It is probably buried 3 to 5 feet deep in this zone. Check out the photos of a few of those avalanches below. The amount of snow on top of the weak layer is making it more difficult to trigger, however, if someone were to find a shallower spot and trigger an avalanche, results would be catastrophic and probably unsurvivable. A snowshoer might get away without triggering an avalanche on this layer, but there is no doubt that a snowmobile could trigger one.&nbsp; It is unknown how widespread this persistent weak layer is, as it has been found on some slopes and not others.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will not find obvious signs of instability like you might with other problems like wind slab avalanches. You need to dig down to the Jan 13 crust and make note of the layer above it, observing the state of any persistent grains and how readily those layers just above the crust fail. I wouldn&rsquo;t place all my bets on one pit for this sort of problem, either. The game is too dangerous to play the odds on.

This terrain lies in NWAC&rsquo;s East Central forecast zone. At least 8 other large avalanches were observed in the area. The other avalanches likely released within the last day or two. Initial avalanche classification: HS-AV-R3-D3-O.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">--------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crystal Mountain patrollers were able to get some visibility over toward Mt. Rainier today and confirmed a very large avalanche occurred. Several other widely propagating avalanches were spotted in the surrounding terrain. These all are suspected to have run between Thursday and Sunday and many of them look to have broken similarly to the persistent slabs we have identified elsewhere in the zone. Until now, we hadn&rsquo;t seen any avalanches on these weak layers at Mount Rainier National Park, and although unconfirmed, we&rsquo;ll take a leap of faith that these slides failed on one of our two layers of concern. We had positively identified these layers of concern near Paradise on Thursday just as the storm cycle was getting started.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have had a lot of large and dangerous avalanches in the West South this past week and unfortunately, the setup remains for these slides to continue. You need to keep approaching terrain with caution and being suspicious of open terrain features greater than 30 degrees. There were multiple avalanche involvements and close calls this past weekend, including a good free lesson from <a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210207_jim-hill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stevens Pass</a>.

You can dig down to determine the existence of these weak layers, but a single hole in the ground shouldn&rsquo;t be a tool for ruling them out in your area. In some areas of the zone, these layers may be close to a meter deep and you may not experience signs of instability as you travel. Just because you are not seeing obvious signs of instability does not mean that you have chosen the appropriate terrain. We have some uncertainty about what it would take to trigger one of these slides at this point, but it could be a step down from a smaller avalanche, a snowmobile, cornice, or even just a shallower spot in the snowpack. What we do know is that if you trigger one of these avalanches and are caught, it would most likely be unsurvivable.</span></p>",

Convex rollovers or slopes over 35 degrees should be more prone to triggering avalanches, whether they are wind-loaded or not. There should be plenty of density changes and interstorm layers in the upper snowpack for you to investigate as potential failure points. As you travel, you can use uptrack tests or test slopes to see how the recent snow is reacting to your weight. Look for visual clues such as textured snow surfaces, freshly built cornices, or smooth pillow-like piles of snow to help you identify where the wind has affected the snow. In some areas, these visual clues may be hidden by low-density snow that fell on Sunday night. If so, try to feel for subtle differences in the snow as you travel. You could find that the snow feels firm and hollow, indicating a harder Wind Slab. You should avoid any slope greater than 35 degrees that you suspect is wind-loaded.</span></p>",

Observers on Delancey Ridge reported about half as much storm snow and still found tests indicating propagation on the Jan 30th interface of facets and surface hoar at 6050ft on a southeast aspect. On Sunday, observers dug a profile on a <a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210207_hwy-20/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SW aspect at 7,200ft</a> and found reactive storm interfaces down 1 foot and a layer of rounding facets (likely Jan 30th) about 2 feet below the surface.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On Saturday, a skier intentionally triggered a small wind slab on a cross-loaded southwest slope at 7400ft near Washington Pass. On Friday, a large ski triggered avalanche was reported near treeline along with several small wind slabs in steep terrain below cliff features in Cutthroat drainage. Last Wednesday, we believe that a significant portion of Portley Bowl avalanched naturally following a <a href=\"https://nwac.us/public-obs/20210202_washington-pass-portley-bowl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ski triggered slab</a> on a smaller part of the bowl on Tuesday.
